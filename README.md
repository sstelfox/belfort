# Belfort

This is pure ruby implementation of the board game
[Belfort](http://playtmg.com/products/belfort). I'm writing it mostly as a way
to improve my test writing abilities, and if the project gets far enough along
to rapidly test various strategies for use in the board game itself.

This is never intended to be 'playable' version. I am minorly concerned that TMG
might not look kindly on this project if it were too become a playable version.

To TMG in the event they find this project: I have only the utmost respect for
your board games and this project is based on that appreciation. If you feel
this project might take any revenue from you let me know and I'll take it down.

## A Note on Rules

To everyone that finds this, please note that the codified mechanics are based
on my interpretation of the rules and these may differ from what you're used
too if you've interpreted something differently.

Generally the rules are pretty well covered and the few places that might have
put me slightly off were covered in the forum on rule
[clarification](http://boardgamegeek.com/forum/384119/belfort/rules).

One of the things that got me was a misprint between the Thieve's Guild card
and the rulebook. From one of the game designers though:

    I believe there is a misprint in the rulebook - the Theives' Guild tile is
    correct. You steal 2 gold from any 1 player, or 1 gold each from up to 3
    different players.
