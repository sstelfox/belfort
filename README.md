# Belfort

This is pure ruby implementation of the board game Belfort. I'm writing it
mostly as a way to improve my test writing abilities, and if the project gets
far enough along to rapidly test various strategies for use in the board game
itself.

This is never intended to be 'playable' version. I am minorly concerned that TMG
might not look kindly on this project if it were too become a playable version.

To TMG in the event they find this project: I have only the utmost respect for
your board games and this project is based on that appreciation. If you feel
this project might take any revenue from you let me know and I'll take it down.

## Installation
